# Sprint backlog

The second Scrum artifact is a sprint backlog. The list of items selected from the product backlog, which will be completed in the current sprint, constitute the **sprint backlog**. This list of items selected in the [sprint planning](../scrum/sprint-planning.md) and the status of these items are discussed in the [sprint review](../scrum/sprint-review.md) event.

Even the daily monitoring of sprint backlog is done in the [daily scrum](../scrum/daily-scrum.md) where each member tells to the team about the task done by that person. The development team regularly updates the sprint backlog.

As long as the goal of the sprint does not change, the development team can freely change and update the sprint backlog. If there is anything that can lead to not achieving the goal of the sprint, that should be highlighted to the product owner and stakeholders immediately.

The sprint backlog is highly visible. The estimated remaining work can be viewed in real time by the entire Scrum team and the stakeholders.

If you remember in the [sprint retrospective](../scrum/sprint-retrospective.md) event, the team tries to identify what it can do to improve itself to ensure continuous improvement.

>[!TIP]
> The sprint backlog is a list of items on which the development team is currently working on.

The development team wants the sprint backlog and all progress on it can be viewed by this Scrum team and the other stakeholders.
