# Advantages and disadvantages

The first advantage is that Scrum is more transparent and provides more project visibility. So, with [daily stand-up](../scrum/daily-scrum.md), the whole team knows who is doing what and issues are identified in advance, which improves the communication and enabling the team to take care of issues right away. It increases the team's accountability. There is not project management as such. Instead, the team collectively decides what work they can complete in each sprint, working together collaboratively with accountability.

With short sprints and constant feedback, it is easier to accommodate changes. It works well for fast moving development projects. It provides more cost savings. Constant communication ensures the team is aware of all issues and changes sooner, helping to lower expensive and increase quality. Therefore provides and ensures effective use of time and money.

It enables faster delivery. Scrum can help teams complete project deliverables quickly and efficiently. Customers are heard.

Scrum is based on [Agile](../agile/index.md) and adopts continuous feedback from customers and stakeholders, which not only improves the product but also avoids any issues later.

## Disadvantages

While Scrum offers some concrete benefits, it also has some downside. Scrum requires a high level of experience and commitment from the team.

First disadvantage is some Scrum project gain experience scope creep which is receiving continuous change in the project scope due to a lack of specific requirements and goal. Also, stakeholders keep requesting additional functionality: this not only impact the project timeline but it would also affect the project cost. The team needs to be familiar with Scrum principles to succeed as well as needs to commit the daily meetings and stay on the team for the entire project.

Sometimes, daily meetings are frustrating members and therefore changes of project failure are high if individuals are not very committed or cooperative.

The wrong Scrum master can ruin everything because being a Scrum master is very different that being a project manager. The Scrum master does not have authority over the team, He must trust the team to complete the work.

Poorly defined tasks can lead to inaccuracies. Project cost and timelines won't be accurate if tasks are not well-defined.

If the initial goals are unclear, planning becomes difficult and sprints can take more time than originally estimated. Proper planning and smart decision making can help you get past these disadvantages with Scrum methodologies.

For example, in large teams, each member needs to have defined roles and responsibilities with defined goals. So, there is no compromise on quality and no excuse for failure. This will keep the team focus to the project goals. The Scrum master needs to guide the team effectively to avoid pitfalls and ensure 100% project success.
