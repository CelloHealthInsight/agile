# Increment

Increment is the final releasable output created during the sprint. Increment has the following characteristics:

First, it should be usable; it should be ready for production; whether it is actually used or not is decided by the product owner and the stakeholders but from the development team, the delivery is a **usable product**.

Secondly, it should be inspected. It should be a complete solution that can be tested and verified. With incomplete testing we cannot say that the item is complete and cannot be market as done.

Thirdly, it would include increments of previous sprint. That means that it is not something standalone, the development was done over the existing product with all the improvement.

There is no single **definition of done**, you only have to decide it. Make sure that everyone agrees with the same definition of done. As a team gets mature and comfortable in using Scrum, you can put even more stricter rules on the definition of done to improve the quality.
