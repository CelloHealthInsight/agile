# Sprint retrospective

After the [sprint review](../scrum/sprint-review.md) event where we updated the product backlog based on the output of the sprint, the Scrum team does this event called **Sprint retrospective**.

>[!TIP]
> In this event, stakeholders are not invited.

The agenda of this event is not to discuss the output of the sprint but inspect the performance of the team: what went well and what could be improved.

What the team did well should be noted down and the team should try to build a practice around it. What went wrong should be noted as an area of potential improvement.

The reason of using a Scrum framework is not just to deliver product increments regularly but it is also growth of the team and its members to help to continue to improve the relationships, processes and tools.

This event is for the inspection and adaptation of the Scrum team itself. After the Scrum retrospective, the entire Scrum team should know the area of improvement and the planner working on them.

The retrospective is a time boxed event: no more than 3 hours.

>[!NOTE]
> Scrum should increase efficiency and this rules ensures that the opposite does not happen
