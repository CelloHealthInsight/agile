# Development team

Development team is a group of people who work on the requirements and deliver a potentially releasable product at the end of each sprint. **Sprint** is another scrum event. Basically, I will release an upgrade to the previous product with new features that is covering some of the requirements from the [product backlog](../agile/product_backlog.md) every month. 

This regular interval of a month (ore less) is called **sprint** and this is the time in which the development team gets to create new releasable product covering some of the requirements from the product backlog.

As far as authorities concerned, organization must give the freedom to organize and manage their own work. What is to be done is decided by the [product owner](../scrum/product-owner.md).

## How is left to the development team?

Now, let's look at the characteristics of a Scrum development team. There are 2 main characteristics of a Scrum development team. First, it is **cross-functional**. This means that all the skills required for doing the work and backlog are available within the team and there is no external dependency.

Secondly, Scrum teams are **self-organizing**. They are the ones who will decide how the next potentially releasable product is to be made. No one tells them how the work is to be done.

Now, you must have noticed that in a team, some individuals have specialized skills or some group of individual people have some area of focus, such as testing, architecture, operations etc. But Scrum has a strict rule that there will be **no titles and no subteams** within the development team. The development team is one unit and they are accountable for the development work.

Lastly, one common concern is that what should be the ideal team size. There is no wrong answer to this question and it actually depends on several factors, including your organization, product and its complexity, etc. However, it is suggested that our team size of 3 to 9 members is good. Less number of people leads to less interaction which cost productivity. On the other hand, if we have too many people it becomes difficult to coordinate.

However, I have seen larger teams also working efficiently, but as a general rule of thumb, the limits of 3 and 9 are good.
