# Scrum events

There are 5 main events in Scrum.

- [Sprint](../scrum/sprint.md)
- [Sprint planning](../scrum/sprint-planning.md)
- [Daily Scrum](../scrum/daily-scrum.md)
- [Sprint review](../scrum/sprint-review.md)
- [Sprint retrospective](../scrum/sprint-retrospective.md)

Before starting to talk about each of them, I like to highlight some features of these events.

The first feature is that these events are regular, some events can be monthly or weekly or even daily. Whatever the frequency is, it has to be regularly done after that internal. 

Also, these events are timed boxed which means that there is a limit on the duration of these events. For example, the daily Scrum is a 15 minutes meeting. This meeting must end within 15 minutes. These is to ensure that these events do not interrupt the actual development work.

One should always remember that all these events, team structuring, artifacts etc are supposed to increase efficiency. At any point of time, if the team feels that any of these things are counterproductive, such concerns should be highlighted to the Scrum master.

The [Scrum master](../scrum/scrum-master.md) needs to ensure that the implementation of Scrum rules is done properly.

So, this rule of time boxing event is basically to prevent wastage of time and have an efficient meeting.

Lastly, these events are also based on the [3 pillars](../scrum/pillars.md) of transparency, inspection and adaptation. Events like Sprint, Sprint planning and retrospective are aimed at increasing transparency and events like the daily Scrum and Sprint review are aimed to detect and rectify early of any deviation from the intended product.
