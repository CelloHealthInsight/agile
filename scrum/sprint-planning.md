# Sprint planning

As the name suggests, this is a meeting in which the plan for the spring is fixed. This event happens once in each print. The entire Scrum team ([product owner](../scrum/product-owner.md), [Scrum master](../scrum/scrum-master.md) and [developer team](../scrum/development-team.md)) must be a part of this sprint planning event. The time box for this event is 8 hours maximum. Most of the Sprint planning meetings that I have been a part of were nearly 4 to 5 yours each. If you have a month long sprint, it can actually take 8 hours.

So, there are 2 agendas of the sprint planning meeting: one is to identify what is to be done in the sprint and the other is establish how it will be done. So, at the end of the sprint, we have a potentially shippable product increment.

## What is to be done?

If you remember the responsibility of a [product owner](../scrum/product-owner.md) is to maintain a product backlog which is the list of all the pending items in the order in which they have to be done. The product owner discuss the list with the development team and explains all the items that can be picked up in this sprint. Then, the development team assess all the items to decide what can be done in the sprint. For this assessment, they can use the empirical data points, such as how much work were they able to do in the previous few sprints. This is also known as **team velocity** (remember the Agile [velocity](../agile/velocity.md)?).

Now, the team has to estimate how much time each task will take. The product owner and the scrum master can also arrange Agile activities like [estimation poker](../agile/estimation.md). With all these information and objectives discussed by the product owner, the development team has to decide what will be done in this sprint. The list of items which will be completed in this sprint are called **sprint backlog**. The sprint backlog is those items from the product backlog which the development team will deliver in this sprint.

## How it will be done?

Now, the next objective is to decide how this work will be done within the sprint. This is also something which development team needs to do. As we said before, the development team is **self-organizing**. They are fully capable of deciding how to organize the work. Since we are working on the basis of estimated effort, the plan is not fixed and it actually evolves as clarity increases. But still, at the end of this current sprint planning, the development team should be able to tell the product owner how they are planning to deliver the product increment and what is the exact plan of action for the next few days.

The role of the Scrum master is to facilitate this event and to complete it within the time frame. Also, he ensures that everyone understands the agenda and rules for this event. Scrum master is responsible for the success of all these events.
