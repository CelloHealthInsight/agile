# Agile with Azure DevOps

[Azure DevOps](https://www.puresourcecode.com/tag/azure-devops/) provides 4 processes as standard. When creating a project, the default process is Agile. However, by browsing to Advanced, you will be prompted to choose between the available processes.

- **Basic**: This is the simplest process provided by Azure DevOps. The basic process tracks tasks from not started, doing and done and only tracks three types of work items. These are epics, issues and tasks.
- **CMMI**: The Capability Maturity Model index closely relates to a standard waterfall methodology. It includes work items which allows a formal change management process. Work items which allows the project team access to Risks, Issues and Decisions from within Azure DevOps.
- **Agile**: The agile process is, as you’d expect it to be, a process which adheres to Agile principles. So, the terminology used to define work items as well as the functionality available makes this process quite popular for projects running an agile methodology.
- **Scrum**: Scrum is a variation of agile with different terminology. Azure DevOps, similarly with the agile process has terminology specific to the Scrum process.

You may question having both Agile and Scrum processes and be confused about the differences. One of the main differences that you'll encounter is that within the Agile process, tasks can be tracked by there original estimate, remaining work as well as completed work. However, if using the scrum process, tasks can only be tracked by the task’s remaining work.
