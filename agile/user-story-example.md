# User story examples

> As a [**customer**], I want [**shopping cart feature**] so that [**I can easily purchase items online**].

So, the end user over here is the customer. This story is being written from the perspective of an end user to the role as customer. So, in the **action**, the intent is clearly defined, which is a shopping cart feature and it is implementation free. That means, it doesn't define any technical part. It just defines the intent and what actually the user is trying to achieve. Coming to the **benefit**, it defines the bigger picture and the overall benefit the user is trying to achieve, which is through this shopping cart feature, they can easily purchase items online.

> As a [**manager**], I want to [**generate a report**] so that [**I can understand which departments need more resources**].
>
> As a [**customer**], I want to [**receive an SMS when the item is arrived**] so that [**I can go pick it up right away**].
>
> As a [**manager**], I want to be able to [**understand my colleagues progress**], so I can [**better report our success and failures**].

## INVEST

The acronym **INVEST** helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria or checklist to assess the quality of a user story. If a user story fails to meet one of these criteria, the team may want to reword it or ever consider rewrite it.

- **I**ndependent (of all others)
- **N**egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
- **V**aluable
- **E**stimable (to a good approximation)
- **S**mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
- **T**estable (in principle, even if there isnâ€™t a test for it yet)

**Independent** means the user story should be self-contained in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another user story. **Negotiable** means user story are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion. **Valuable** means a user story must deliver value to our stakeholders and/or business. **Estimable** highlights that you must always be able to estimate the size of a user story. **Small** stresses on the fact that the story should not be so big as to become impossible to plan or prioritize with a certain level of certainty. The user story should be **testable** which means user story and the related description provide the necessary information to make the test development possible.
