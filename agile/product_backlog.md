# Product backlog

A backlog is something which lists and prioritizes the task level. It is required to execute on the strategic plan set in the road map. The backlog essentially should communicate what is next on the development teams to do list as they execute on the read maps.

Typical items in a product backlog includes [user stories](../agile/user-story.md), new features, changes to existing functionalities, bug fixes and other tasks like infrastructure changes.

Product backlog is a single source of things that it works on, often referred ad **single source of true**. That means nothing gets done that isn't on the product backlog. The presence of a product backlog item on a product backlog not guarantee that it will be delivered. It is a translation of how your team will deliver the vision outlined on Agile road map.

So, in many ways, it is a giant to do list for your development team.

Product backlog contains short description of functionality desired in the product, and it can be represented in physical form using index cards or sticky notes.Also, it may be represented in electronic form as a text file or modern tools like [Microsoft Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) or [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

The team owns this product backlog and we have a specific role that is **product owner** with the primary responsability of maintaining the product backlog. Product backlog items take a variety of formats with the user stories being the most common.

The sequence of product backlog items on product backlog changes as a team gains a better understanding of the outcome and the identified solution.

This reordering of existing product backlog items, the ongoing addition and removal of product backlog item and the continuous refinement of product backlog items gives the product backlog its dynamic characteristic.
