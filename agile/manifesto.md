# Manifesto explained

In the section [How was born](./how-was-born.md) I told you how [Agile](./index.md) was born and how its popularity is growing. Now, I like to explain better the manifesto itself and why it is important.

First, the Agile Manigesto in short is the collection of **values** and **principles** giving people a common fundation for making decisions about the best way to develop software.

## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

This is the center of Agile. The researches show an increase of performances of up 50 times when we get individuals and interactions right. Valuing people more highly then processes and tools is easy to understand becuase it is the people who respond to business needs and drive the development process.

If the process or tools drive development, the team is less responsive to change and less likely to meet customers needs.

Communication is an example of the difference between valuing individuals versus process. In case of individuals, communication is fluid and happens when a need arises. In the case of process, communication is scheduled and requires specific content. Communication definitely needs to be free flowing and continuous, non defined and scheduled. Working in closed off silos is not what Agile is all about.

## Working software over comprehensive documentation

Let's understand this by assuming you wrote a functional specificion document that came to 50 pages long, it outlined all functional behaviour of the site we were building, including wire frames.

It took a lot of time to create and guess what? Things changed.

The functional specification you wee working became more and more out of date. It took time to update. So, you ended up ditching it and just working with the site itself, which highlights getting stuff done, is better than talking or writing about getting stuff done.

While Agile does not eliminate documentation, bui it streamlines it in a form that gives the developers what it needed to do the work. The Agile manifesto values documentation, but it values working software more.

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Negotiation is the period when the customer and the product manager work out the details of a delivery with points along the way where the details may be renegotiated.

Collaboration is a different creature altogether. With the development models such as [Waterfall](../waterfall/waterfall.md), customers negotiate the requirements for the product, often in great detail prior to any work starting. This meant the customer was involved in the process of development, before development begin and after it was completed, but not during the process.

The Agile Manifesto describes a customer who is engaged and collaborate throughout the development process making. This makes it far easier for development team to meet the needs of the customer. Instead of fixing a contract in stone at the beginning of the project, it tries to fix as little as possible. Resolve decisions throughout your project by collaborating closely with your clients and stakeholders, give them what they want and need to avoid any issues later.

## Responding to change over following a plan

Studies have shown that 60% of features developed under the waterfall model are rarely used or never used.

Now, this is where Agile really starts to push out the more traditional waterfall methods. With Waterfall methods, the requirements, cost and timing are all set up front whereas Agile allows for and actually embraces changes.

How many project plans have worked out for you exactly as you created them as the beginning?

## Fun fact

While it may be surprising, there are a lot of managers who want to _make their teams Agile_ yet don’t understand Agile and Scrum. Or they (mistakenly) believe that they get it. And they usually don’t. Most believe that even if they don’t understand it, agile will somehow magically improve productivity or allow people to get more work done.

The good news is everyone is onto agile these days. The bad news is people are onto agile without knowing what it entails.
